It is certain
Without a doubt
Yes — definitely
You may rely on it
Signs point to yes
Absolutely
The stars say yes
Fate agrees
All signs align
The outcome looks good
Ask again later
Better not tell you now
Cannot predict at this time
The answer is unclear
Focus and try again
The future is hazy
Results are mixed
Too soon to say
Let time decide
The path is still forming
Don’t count on it
My reply is no
Very doubtful
Outlook not so good
The answer is no
The odds are against you
It’s unlikely
Signs point to no
The universe says no
Best to reconsider
Try again after coffee
Even the 8-ball is confused
That’s a you problem
The vibes are off
Ask your mum
The Wi-Fi is down, try later
Error 404: answer not found
The ball says “maybe-ish”
The answer exists, but not for you
Don’t ask questions you’re not ready for
